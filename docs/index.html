<strong>Indigo plugin to control the Aviosys IP9258 IP power switch</strong>

The <a href="http://www.aviosys.com/9258st.html">AVIOSYS IP9258</a> is a 4 outlet power distribution switch that allows individual outlets to be switched on &amp; off remotely via a wired Ethernet connection. This plugin extends the <a href="http://www.indigodomo.com/index.html">Perceptive Automation Indigo </a>Mac home automation application to support the IP9258 and allow each outlet to be configured and controlled as a separate device. Models supporting UK, European &amp; US power outlets are available.

I’ve used these to replace X10 appliance modules where a number of devices need to be controlled within a small area (e.g. behind the TV) or where the devices being switched require a higher degree of reliability than can be achieved using X10.
<h3>Installation</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Download the plugin bundle to the Mac running Indigo &amp; unzip it if necessary</li>
	<li>Double-click on the IP9258.indigoPlugin file: Indigo will ask if you would like to install it</li>
	<li>The plugin’s configuration screen will pop up. Just hit Save to carry on.</li>
</ol>

The details are reasonably self-explanatory:

	<li>Username: username used to log into the PDU. “admin” is the default value</li>
	<li>Password: password used to log into the PDU. “12345678” is the default value</li>
	<li>PDU outlet: the outlet you wish to control (1 - 4)</li>
</ul>

3. Enter the details relating to your IP9258 configuration &amp; press “Save” once complete.
4. Repeat for as many devices as required.
